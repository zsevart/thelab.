    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>The Lab is a new upscale cocktail bar in San Luis Obispo, CA. What makes The Lab stand out from other cocktail bars is the fact that The Lab is based upon the principle of do it yourself. The Lab allows its customers to unleash their creativity and develop their dream cocktail, or mocktail. Inside of The Lab, there are long high-top tables where guests will be seated while they wait for a bartender to come over and give them a drink guide and debrief them about the experience. Guests will be given time to dream up their cocktail and consult with a bartender. Then, a bartender will take their order for their ingredients, supplies, and glassware. The various juices and ingredients will be brought out in test tubes and beakers and the guests can add their ingredients into their cocktail shaker, shake it up, and pour it into their glass.
